Description: 
        Assimulo is a Cython / Python based simulation package that allows for 
        simulation of both ordinary differential equations (ODEs), f(t,y), and 
        differential algebraic equations (DAEs), f(t,y,yd). It combines a 
        variety of different solvers written in C and Python via a common 
        high-level interface.
        
        Assimulo currently supports Explicit Euler, adaptive Runge-Kutta of 
        order 4 and Runge-Kutta of order 4. It also wraps the popular SUNDIALS 
        (https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html) solvers CVode 
        (for ODEs) and IDA (for DAEs). A Python version of Ernst Hairer's code 
        (http://www.unige.ch/~hairer/software.html) Radau5 is also available.

        The package requires Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib and additionally for 
        compiling from source, Cython 0.15 and Sundials 2.4.
