## PyFilaments
[PyFilaments](https://github.com/deepakkrishnamurthy/PyFilaments) is a Python library to simulate the dynamics of active filaments. The filaments are built out of spherical particles with Dirichlet (velocity) or Neumann (stress) boundary conditions on their surfaces. The library uses the [PyStokes](https://gitlab.com/rajeshrinet/pystokes) library for calculating Rigid body motions of the spheres and their flows. Connection forces due to non-linear springs and bending potentials are applied to simulate the elasto-hydrodynamics of active filaments.
